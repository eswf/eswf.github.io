## Overview of the Situation

Two Enhanced Risk (ENH) areas have been outlined for July 25th. The first covers parts of Germany and Czechia, and the second includes eastern Germany and western Poland. These zones feature moderate instability, with MLCAPE values ranging from 1000 to 1600 J/kg, and effective shear values between 25–35 kt, particularly favorable for organized multicells and low-end supercells. Mid-level lapse rates are generally steep across both zones (around 6.5–7°C/km), contributing to the potential for large hail, strong wind gusts, and localized heavy rain.

Surrounding these ENH areas, Slight Risk (SLGT) zones extend into broader parts of Germany, Czechia, and western Poland. Here, weaker shear and moderate CAPE still allow for stronger showers or isolated strong storms, especially during peak heating hours.

The Marginal Risk (MRGL) surrounds all higher risk areas and stretches into Switzerland, Austria, and Slovakia, where storm development is less certain but isolated convection or storm remnants from upstream areas may trigger localized heavy showers. Conditions in these areas generally feature lower instability, modest shear, and limited forcing, though brief thunderstorm activity cannot be ruled out.

## Synopsis

In ENH Risk 1, the German sounding shows MLCAPE values around 1300 J/kg, dry mid-levels, and 25–30 kt deep-layer shear, which could support scattered multicells capable of strong downdrafts and hail, especially if convective inhibition can be overcome. The Czech sounding shows similar CAPE, paired with steep lapse rates and sufficient moisture, suggesting a risk for stronger convection later in the day, including isolated severe storms with heavy rain and small hail.

ENH Risk 2 shows slightly stronger instability on both sides of the Germany–Poland border, with CAPE nearing 1600 J/kg and well-curved hodographs indicating potential for storm organization, albeit mostly in the form of clusters or bowing segments. These storms may bring localized wind damage and hail.

In the SLGT Risk 1 zone, a German sounding shows CAPE near 800–1000 J/kg and weak to moderate shear, which favors diurnally driven convection, including stronger showers or brief pulse storms. The SLGT Risk 2 zone (near and around ENH 2) shows similar conditions in Germany and Czechia, with slightly weaker lapse rates, but still enough instability to warrant the risk of isolated severe cells, particularly where outflow boundaries or terrain effects provide lift.

MRGL Risk areas over Switzerland and Austria are supported by soundings with modest instability (~600–800 J/kg CAPE) and limited shear. These profiles suggest that most activity will be in the form of isolated showers or weak storms, though local terrain could help focus activity in the afternoon.

The MRGL Risk 2 in Slovakia is based on weak CAPE but high low-level moisture, indicating a setup supportive of heavy rainfall showers, especially near hills or valleys where moisture may pool. Severe potential remains very low, but localized flooding could become a concern with slow-moving storms.
