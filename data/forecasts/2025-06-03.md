## Overview of the Situation

A broad area of moderate instability and marginally favorable shear covers much of Central and Eastern Europe today, with Austria and Hungary exhibiting the most pronounced potential for organized thunderstorms, including severe multicells and transient supercells. Germany and Poland lie in a somewhat less favorable, but still supportive, convective environment. Meanwhile, Switzerland remains mostly capped with limited instability, making thunderstorm development unlikely there.

A moist boundary layer, diurnal surface heating, and steep low- to mid-level lapse rates characterize most profiles. While deep-layer shear is sufficient across the region, upper-level support is weak, suggesting pulse-type convection or organized clusters depending on localized triggers. Orographic influences and frontal boundaries will be key to convective initiation.

## Synopsis

Austria and Hungary show MLCAPE around 1000-1200 J/kg, with adequate deep-layer shear (20-25 m/s) and veering wind profiles. This supports organized convection, including multicells, splitting cells, and short-lived supercells. Moisture is deep, and storm bases are low, with enhanced potential for large hail, strong wind gusts, and isolated tornadoes in case of storm interaction or terrain-enhanced convergence.

Germany and Poland exhibit moderate instability (700-1000 J/kg MLCAPE), steep lapse rates (~7 K/km), and dry mid-levels, which may limit convective coverage but enhance downburst potential. Shear profiles support storm organization, especially with locally merging cells, though overall dynamics are weaker than farther south. Primary risks include hail and strong winds.

Switzerland, by contrast, shows a capped and weakly unstable profile (<500 J/kg CAPE), with dry layers aloft and minimal shear. Without substantial surface triggers or orographic lifting, convective development is unlikely, and any storms that do form would likely be isolated and non-severe, yet some models expect strong linear segments that will form and make its way towards Austria. Because of that Switzerland is still located in the ENH risk.
