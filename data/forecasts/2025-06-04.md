## Updated outlook as of 14:00 UTC (GMT):

An upgrade to High Risk has been issued based on the latest high-resolution model guidance and rapidly evolving environmental conditions. The primary reason for this update is clearing skies, which are allowing for significant surface heating and destabilization of the boundary layer. Morning convection has cleared the area of interest to the north, and satellite imagery confirms increasing insolation across the region. A strong cap has so far suppressed convective initiation, but this is forecast to weaken steadily into the evening as upper-level subsidence decreases and diabatic heating continues. Observations and soundings indicate a developing loaded gun profile with MUCAPE exceeding 1800 J/kg and deep-layer shear values over 25 m/s, supporting
potential for explosive supercell development once the cap erodes. Dryline interactions and a weak low-level vortex over southeastern Bavaria may serve as foci for isolated convective initiation during the late afternoon. Should initiation occur along these boundaries, the environment will support rapidly intensifying updrafts capable of producing very large hail and severe to extreme wind gusts. Some CAMs consistently show CI (convective initiation) southwest of Munich, which could place the city directly in the path of potentially dangerous storms.

At the same time, convection currently developing over Switzerland is expected to organize into a large MCS as it spreads northeastward into the High-Risk area later this evening and overnight. Model solutions vary regarding the storm mode, with some favoring a bow echo evolution and others a mesoscale convective vortex (MCV). Regardless, the combination of strong instability, minimal capping, and 0-3 km shear values in the 15-20 m/s range will support the potential for long-tracked bowing segments and embedded supercells, capable of producing widespread damaging winds and large hail. In response to the latest trends, the Moderate Risk area has been shifted eastward, and the Enhanced Risk has been expanded into parts of southern and southwestern Poland, reflecting the expected overnight progression of the convective complex out of Czechia.

## Overview of the Situation

A dynamic convective setup is unfolding across Central Europe, with Switzerland, Germany, Czechia, and Poland all falling under varying degrees of thunderstorm risk. The moderate risk (MDT) zones exhibit well-developed instability, deep moisture, and strong shear, supportive of severe convective modes including supercells, large to very large hail, severe winds, isolated tornadoes and possibly a derecho (bow echo) formation in the MDT risks. In contrast, the SLGT/MRGL areas, while still unstable, show less organized profiles due to weaker shear, capping, or less focused lift, resulting in more scattered convection and isolated severe storms.

## Synopsis

Within the Moderate Risk zone, all four countries-Switzerland, Germany, Czechia, and Poland-exhibit very favorable environments for severe thunderstorms. Instability is moderate to strong across the region, with mixed-layer CAPE generally ranging from 1200 to 2000 J/kg and locally exceeding 2000 J/kg in parts of Germany. Wind shear is consistently strong, with deep-layer values around 20 to 30 m/s, which supports sustained, organized storm structures. Steep mid-level lapse rates, typically between 7.5 and 8.0 K/km, combine with relatively low lifting condensation levels, suggesting that storms will be surface-based with the potential for strong updrafts and explosive convective growth. Hodographs are either curved or elongated, favoring both discrete supercells and potential storm splitting. These conditions together point toward a significant threat for very large hail, severe wind gusts, and tornadoes, particularly in regions where mesoscale lifting and low-level backing of surface winds enhance storm rotation.

Germany likely holds the most volatile environment of the group, showing both high instability and well-structured wind profiles conducive to discrete tomadic supercells and later upscale growth into bowing convective segments. Czechia shares a very similar profile, though perhaps with slightly drier low-levels, still supportive of supercells capable of large to very large hail and damaging winds. Switzerland's Moderate Risk area features deeply saturated profiles and terrain-influenced low-level flow, raising the potential for anchored supercells, heavy rainfall, and localized tornadoes. Poland's MDT area, while slightly less moist and perhaps more elevated, still presents a clear threat for organized convection, particularly in the form of splitting supercells and forward-propagating clusters, where damaging wind and hail would be the dominant threats.

In contrast, the Slight and Marginal Risk regions in Switzerland, Germany, and Poland feature weaker thermodynamic support but retain some potential for organized convection under favorable conditions. Instability is lower, generally between 600 and 1000 J/kg, and the wind shear, while still present, is weaker than in the MDT zones, typically ranging around 10 to 20 m/s. Several profiles show signs of capping, especially over Switzerland and northern Poland, which may limit storm coverage or elevate the base of developing convection. In these areas, storms are more likely to be short-lived and locally severe, with the main threats being marginally severe hail and isolated wind gusts. Terrain-induced lift, local boundaries, or low-level convergence will likely play a key role in initiating and sustaining any storms that do form. Germany's SLGT/MRGL regions may still support a few longer-lived cells given somewhat better lapse rates and moderate shear. Meanwhile, Switzerland and northern Poland are less favorable overall, with weaker low-level moisture and less surface-based instability.

In summary, the Moderate Risk zone across central and eastern Europe presents a broad and dangerous potential for organized severe storms, with supercells, tornadoes, very large hail, and damaging winds all possible. While the surrounding Slight and Marginal Risk areas are less favorable overall, they still warrant attention for localized severe weather where mesoscale lift can overcome more marginal ingredients.
