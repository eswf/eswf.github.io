## Updated outlook as of 7:00 UTC (GMT):

Based on the latest model guidance, I’ve decided to keep the Moderate (MDT) risk in place. However, let me be clear right from the start — this is a very uncertain MDT risk. Do not expect widespread severe weather conditions across the entire risk area.

I’ve spent about an hour reviewing all the model data again, and I genuinely believe an MDT risk could materialize if things evolve as many high-resolution models suggest. For instance, ICON-D2, ALADIN, and even ICON-RUC are showing a very similar system developing over Germany. While we can’t definitively call it an MCS, it does appear that it could briefly take on MCS characteristics over Germany before weakening as it moves into Czechia.

Even so, some models are showing gusts exceeding 90 km/h in parts of Czechia, which would justify maintaining the MDT risk. While I don’t expect conditions this strong outside of Germany, several models do, which is why I’ve decided to expand the MDT risk slightly northward into Germany. This will be the final update to the outlook. Apart from this MDT risk adjustment, no other changes have been made to the forecast — the models have consistently depicted this scenario well since yesterday. Please understand that this MDT risk reflects a "not entirely confident" situation. But in such cases, it’s often better to err on the side of caution by issuing a broader warning, rather than underestimating the event and being caught off guard.

## Overview of the Situation

A significant severe weather event is expected to unfold across central Europe today. A Moderate Risk (MDT) area has been introduced for parts of Germany, Czechia, and Poland, where models show a progressive storm system forming during the morning in the Slight Risk (SLGT) area and intensifying throughout the day. The system is forecast to reach peak strength by the afternoon across Germany, before shifting eastward into Czechia and Poland, where it is expected to gradually weaken during the evening hours.

Surrounding the MDT risk is an Enhanced Risk (ENH) zone, including additional parts of Germany, Czechia, and Poland. These areas may still see organized and potentially severe convection, albeit with slightly lower confidence or coverage than in the MDT zone.

The Slight Risk wraps around the ENH zone and represents areas where strong storms are possible but expected to be more isolated or less intense. A broad Marginal Risk (MRGL) covers the outermost regions, where scattered showers or weak storms may form or move in from higher-risk zones, though the severe threat there remains low.

## Synopsis

Latest model guidance suggests a mesoscale convective system (MCS) or line of storms may initiate in the morning within the SLGT risk area and undergo intensification through the afternoon across Germany — forming the core of the Moderate Risk. By mid to late afternoon, this system is expected to travel east into Czechia and Poland, where soundings show favorable instability and shear for organized convection, with threats including damaging winds, hail, and potentially localized flooding. Soundings from all three countries within the MDT zone support strong updraft potential and ample CAPE.

The Enhanced Risk surrounding the MDT zone features slightly weaker but still supportive environments for severe multicells or line segments, especially along boundaries and where outflow interactions occur.

Further out, the Slight Risk includes areas with sufficient CAPE and moderate wind profiles but lower forcing or storm coverage, suggesting more scattered and less organized convection.

The Marginal Risk includes areas where a few thunderstorms may still occur but are expected to remain sub-severe, producing mainly showers or isolated lightning.
