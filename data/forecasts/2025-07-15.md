## Overview of the Situation

A significant severe weather event is expected to unfold across central Europe today. A Moderate Risk (MDT) area has been introduced for parts of Germany, Czechia, and Poland, where models show a progressive storm system forming during the morning in the Slight Risk (SLGT) area and intensifying throughout the day. The system is forecast to reach peak strength by the afternoon across Germany, before shifting eastward into Czechia and Poland, where it is expected to gradually weaken during the evening hours.

Surrounding the MDT risk is an Enhanced Risk (ENH) zone, including additional parts of Germany, Czechia, and Poland. These areas may still see organized and potentially severe convection, albeit with slightly lower confidence or coverage than in the MDT zone.

The Slight Risk wraps around the ENH zone and represents areas where strong storms are possible but expected to be more isolated or less intense. A broad Marginal Risk (MRGL) covers the outermost regions, where scattered showers or weak storms may form or move in from higher-risk zones, though the severe threat there remains low.

## Synopsis

Latest model guidance suggests a mesoscale convective system (MCS) or line of storms may initiate in the morning within the SLGT risk area and undergo intensification through the afternoon across Germany â€” forming the core of the Moderate Risk. By mid to late afternoon, this system is expected to travel east into Czechia and Poland, where soundings show favorable instability and shear for organized convection, with threats including damaging winds, hail, and potentially localized flooding. Soundings from all three countries within the MDT zone support strong updraft potential and ample CAPE.

The Enhanced Risk surrounding the MDT zone features slightly weaker but still supportive environments for severe multicells or line segments, especially along boundaries and where outflow interactions occur.

Further out, the Slight Risk includes areas with sufficient CAPE and moderate wind profiles but lower forcing or storm coverage, suggesting more scattered and less organized convection.

The Marginal Risk includes areas where a few thunderstorms may still occur but are expected to remain sub-severe, producing mainly showers or isolated lightning.
