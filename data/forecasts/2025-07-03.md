## Overview of the Situation

A broad severe weather setup is expected across Central Europe, with an Enhanced Risk centered over Austria, Czechia, and southern Germany, surrounded by a Slight Risk area encompassing parts of Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland, and additional areas of Austria, Germany, and Czechia. A Marginal Risk zone lies further out, including sections of Germany, particularly in association with morning or peripheral convection. The environment is characterized by moderate to strong instability, sufficient deep-layer shear, and localized low-level moisture pooling, all supportive of organized convection, including supercells, multicells, and strong outflow-dominant clusters. The risk of large hail, damaging wind gusts, and isolated tornadoes is highest in the ENH zone, with more scattered and lower-end threats in the surrounding areas.

## Synopsis

Austria, Czechia, and southern Germany show the most volatile profiles, with SBCAPE values from 2000-2500 J/kg, steep lapse rates (7+ K/km), and effective shear near or above 20 m/s. Austria's profile includes veering winds with height and modest low-level curvature, supportive of supercells capable of large hail and damaging winds. Czechia offers strong surface-based instability with minimal capping and shear supportive of organized storms, particularly along terrain features. Germany exhibits a robust deep-layer shear profile with ample instability, favoring multicellular clusters and embedded supercells,
especially in the south.

Surrounding Slight Risk areas in Austria, Poland, Czechia, Germany, Slovenia, and Switzerland exhibit moderate instability (CAPE 1000-1800 J/kg) with varying degrees of shear and capping. These regions are more likely to see scattered storms, some severe, but generally less organized. Slovenia and parts of Austria feature slightly weaker shear but maintain enough instability for pulse or loosely clustered storms. Switzerland and southern Germany show stronger capping, which could delay or limit convective initiation.

In the Marginal Risk zone across Germany, profiles show lower CAPE, weaker shear, and sometimes elevated instability capped by inversions, especially in early morning setups. These areas may see non-surface-based storms, capable of brief hail or gusts, but are unlikely to sustain severe characteristics.

Overall, the environment supports widespread thunderstorm activity, with the most significant impacts expected in the ENH zone, particularly during the afternoon and early evening hours. An upgrade to a Moderate Risk is possible along the border with Czechia and Austria. However, model consensus is still lacking, so we'll need to wait for further guidance.
