## Overview of the Situation

For 10 July 2025 a Marginal Risk is outlined from north Germany trough Central Europe to south of Slovenia, where scattered rain showers are expected
throughout the day. While widespread severe weather appears unlikely, some models suggest the potential for embedded thunderstorms within the broader
precipitation shield. Confidence is low, but limited destabilisation and subtle low-level shear may support an isolated tornado risk, especially along remnant boundaries or weak surface convergence zones.

## Synopsis

Soundings from within the Marginal Risk area indicate a moist low-level environment with surface dew points in the mid to upper teens and weak but
persistent lift. Though CAPE values remain modest (generally under 800 J/kg), the profiles show notable low-level veering and enhanced SRH (storm-relative
helicity) in the lowest 1 km, which-despite the lack of deep instability-may support brief rotating updrafts if convection becomes surface-based. One
sounding shows a relatively saturated profile with small but curved hodographs, hinting at a possible non-supercell tornado setup if stronger mesoscale forcing materialises. Given the overall weak lapse rates and limited shear aloft, any thunderstorm development will likely be short-lived and pulse-type, but low-level spin-ups or funnel clouds can't be ruled out entirely. The situation remains marginal, but worth monitoring, especially with improving model guidance closer to event time.
