## Overview of the Situation

A zone of Enhanced Risk (ENH) has been issued for parts of Poland, where forecast soundings indicate favorable conditions for organized thunderstorms, including the potential for hail and strong wind gusts. Surrounding this zone lies a broader Slight Risk (SLGT) that extends across more of Poland, as well as parts of Germany, Czechia, and Austria. These areas may see scattered strong to marginally severe storms.

The Marginal Risk (MRGL) wraps around all aforementioned zones, indicating a low but non-zero chance of isolated convection or storms moving in from higher-risk areas, with minimal severe weather parameters. In these outer zones, showers and brief thunderstorms are expected to be the dominant mode of activity.

## Synopsis

In Poland, an Enhanced Risk highlights a corridor where deep instability and moderate wind shear align, producing a favorable environment for severe convection. The strongest storms may bring hail and localized damaging winds, particularly during peak afternoon hours. Sounding data supports organized updrafts and mid-level dry air that could enhance downdraft potential.

The Slight Risk zones surrounding this include areas where CAPE and shear are still supportive but where forcing is weaker or more scattered. This area includes eastern Germany, southern Poland, Czechia, and northern Austria, where multicells or pulse-type storms are possible.

The Marginal Risk outlines the broader region where stratiform rain showers and occasional rumbles of thunder may occur. Storms in this zone will likely remain disorganized and short-lived due to less favorable thermodynamic and dynamic conditions.
