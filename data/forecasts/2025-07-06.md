## Updated outlook as of 11:00 UTC (GMT):

An upgrade to a high risk for Slovenia and parts of Austria has been issued based on the latest high-resolution model guidance and rapidly evolving environmental conditions. Most high-resolution models indicate severe to extremely severe rainfall accumulations across the entire high-risk area. Soundings show high values of various types of CAPE, with surface-based CAPE reaching up to 2000 J/kg. DCAPE values around 600 J/kg suggest a significant threat of severe convective wind gusts. Deep-layer shear is forecast to reach up to 30 m/s, supporting rapid development of supercells and organized storm complexes. Some models hint at the formation of MCSs with bowing segments and embedded supercells capable of producing large hail.
Curved hodographs further support the likelihood of supercell development.

Additionally, a moderate risk has been issued for parts of Austria and Czechia, mainly due to the potential for severe wind gusts and high precipitation rates. Soundings from these regions indicate moderate shear up to 25 m/s and CAPE values up to 2000 J/kg in surface-based parcels, with around 1000 J/kg in the mixed layer. Storms are expected to initiate over Austria and move into Czechia during the late evening hours. Although a capping inversion may initially limit storm development in Czechia, the incoming storms are expected to break the cap due to the available CAPE, allowing for further intensification.

Other smaller risk areas have been adjusted according to the latest model guidance, but all other details remain consistent with yesterday's discussion.

## Overview of the Situation

For the 6 July 2025 guidance continues to converge on a severe-weather corridor stretching from the northern Adriatic across Slovenia into south-central Austria and western Hungary, flagged as a provisional Moderate Risk. Here, a deeply moist, strongly unstable warm sector (surface dew-points ~20C and SBCAPE well above 2500 J/kg) noses north-eastward beneath 25-30 m s-1 of effective bulk-shear, setting the stage for rapidly intensifying supercells capable of very large hail, destructive wind gusts and a few tornadoes. An Enhanced Risk arcs around this core: farther east over central/eastern Hungary, north-westward across the rest of Austria and, late at night, into southern Czechia as organised convection races out of the mountains. A second, less certain Enhanced Risk is outlined over southern Germany where some models retain severe parameters while others show convective overturning confidence there will improve with the next model cycle. Surrounding these zones, broad Slight and Marginal Risk belts cover neighbouring portions of Germany and the northern Alps, where ingredients are still supportive of thunderstorms but capping, moisture variability or weaker shear should keep most storms below high-end thresholds.

## Synopsis

In the MDT sector soundings from Slovenia, Austria and western Hungary are remarkably consistent: 0-3 km lapse rates near 8 K km-1 sit atop a deeply mixed boundary layer, while veering low-level winds yield modest but sufficient curvature for mesocyclones. A stout but breakable cap over Slovenia should delay initiation until late afternoon; once breached, supercells should erupt along alpine lee-trough convergence and quickly track north-east, carrying a threat of giant hail and isolated tornadoes into Austria. Farther downstream the Hungarian profile retains exuberant CAPE but exhibits straighter hodographs, hinting at storm splitting and eventual upscale growth into a bowing MCS that could sweep east across the Danube Plain.

The surrounding ENH-1 zone-central/eastern Hungary, much of interior Austria and, overnight, southern Czechia-shares 1800-2400 J/kg of CAPE but with slightly reduced shear (15-22 m s-1). Here, any supercells emerging from the MDT core may evolve into organised multicell clusters producing widespread severe wind swaths and pockets of large hail before gradually weakening toward dawn.

Further west the uncertain ENH-2 over southern Germany features soundings with 1500-2000 J/kg of CAPE and 20 m s-1 shear, but model spread ranges from sustained evening supercells with torrential rain to rapid convective overturning that stabilises the column. This sector may oscillate between higher and lower categories in subsequent updates.

In contrast, Slight and Marginal Risk areas across the northern Alpine rim, the rest of Germany and into Slovakia contain 800-1400 J/kg CAPE and 10-15 m s-1 shear. While isolated storms can still form on local boundaries or orographic lift-bringing brief hail or strong gusts- persistent capping, weaker low-level flow and potential convective debris should prevent widespread severe weather there. If current trends hold, the night will be dominated by a swath of intense storms lifting out of Slovenia/Austria into Hungary and eventually southern Czechia, leaving surrounding regions with more sporadic or stratiform activity.
