## Overview of the Situation

On 14 July 2025, an Enhanced Risk for severe thunderstorms is in place over parts of central and eastern Germany, supported by strong instability and deep-layer shear. A surrounding Slight Risk spans adjacent parts of Germany, Austria, Poland, and Czechia, where conditions will also support scattered strong to severe storms, though with slightly less organization. A broader Marginal Risk encompasses the region, where isolated thunderstorms or showers may develop, though severe parameters remain low.

## Synopsis

A pronounced Enhanced Risk is centered over eastern Germany, where forecast soundings show steep mid-level lapse rates, ample surface moisture, and CAPE exceeding 2000 J/kg, paired with 30-40 kts of effective shear. These parameters support organized multicells and supercell potential, with the primary threats being large hail and damaging winds, and possibly a tornado if storms interact with mesoscale boundaries.

Surrounding Slight Risk areas in Austria and Germany show slightly less instability but still supportive profiles for severe weather, particularly during peak diurnal heating. Farther east into Poland and Czechia, soundings indicate more modest CAPE but localized pockets of instability and adequate shear that could lead to isolated strong storms. Given the spread of ingredients, storm coverage will vary, but scattered severe reports are likely in and near the enhanced zone.

In the Marginal Risk area, model soundings suggest minimal instability and weak shear. However, isolated convection may still occur due to propagating storms from the enhanced/slight risk zones or localized heating, but these are expected to remain non-severe or sub-severe, limited to brief downpours or small hail.
