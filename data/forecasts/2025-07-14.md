## Updated outlook as of 7:00 UTC (GMT):

As of the latest model guidance, the severe weather forecast for 14 July has been updated. Two new Enhanced Risk (ENH) areas have been introduced â€” one across Austria and parts of Slovenia, and another across eastern Poland. These changes are driven by improved model agreement showing a greater overlap of instability and shear in those regions. The previously broad Slight Risk (SLGT) area has also been reduced in size, with less support for widespread severe weather in some areas.

The Austria/Slovenia ENH Risk is based on updated soundings showing strong surface-based instability, steep mid-level lapse rates, and effective shear supportive of organized multicells and supercells. The primary hazards include large hail, damaging winds, and locally heavy rainfall. The thermodynamic environment appears favorable especially during late afternoon to early evening.

The Poland ENH Risk is supported by robust CAPE values, sufficient low-level moisture, and increasing wind profiles aloft, pointing toward severe storm development with potential for hail and strong wind gusts. The timing and mesoscale boundaries will likely dictate exact storm coverage, but multiple models now consistently highlight this corridor.

Elsewhere, while a Slight Risk remains in place surrounding these two enhanced zones, the area has been trimmed where confidence in storm coverage or severity has decreased. Marginal areas still exist outside the SLGT boundary, but any storms there are expected to remain isolated and less intense.

## Overview of the Situation

On 14 July 2025, an Enhanced Risk for severe thunderstorms is in place over parts of central and eastern Germany, supported by strong instability and deep-layer shear. A surrounding Slight Risk spans adjacent parts of Germany, Austria, Poland, and Czechia, where conditions will also support scattered strong to severe storms, though with slightly less organization. A broader Marginal Risk encompasses the region, where isolated thunderstorms or showers may develop, though severe parameters remain low.

## Synopsis

A pronounced Enhanced Risk is centered over eastern Germany, where forecast soundings show steep mid-level lapse rates, ample surface moisture, and CAPE exceeding 2000 J/kg, paired with 30-40 kts of effective shear. These parameters support organized multicells and supercell potential, with the primary threats being large hail and damaging winds, and possibly a tornado if storms interact with mesoscale boundaries.

Surrounding Slight Risk areas in Austria and Germany show slightly less instability but still supportive profiles for severe weather, particularly during peak diurnal heating. Farther east into Poland and Czechia, soundings indicate more modest CAPE but localized pockets of instability and adequate shear that could lead to isolated strong storms. Given the spread of ingredients, storm coverage will vary, but scattered severe reports are likely in and near the enhanced zone.

In the Marginal Risk area, model soundings suggest minimal instability and weak shear. However, isolated convection may still occur due to propagating storms from the enhanced/slight risk zones or localized heating, but these are expected to remain non-severe or sub-severe, limited to brief downpours or small hail.
