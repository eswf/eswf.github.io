## Overview of the Situation

On 2 June 2025, a broadly unstable and increasingly dynamic environment dominates Central Europe, with Czechia, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, and Switzerland all lying within or near zones of potential convective development. The setup is driven by ample surface-based instability, moderate to strong wind shear, and increasing mid-level cooling, supporting conditions for organized thunderstorms. The highest severe risk spans across Germany and Czechia, with Austria and Slovakia slightly less primed but still supportive of locally strong storms. Switzerland shows signs of suppressed convection due to weaker instability and capping.

## Synopsis

Across Germany and Czechia, a well-mixed boundary layer supports MLCAPE values exceeding 1000 J/kg, coupled with steep lapse rates (7.5-8 K/km) and 0-6 km shear reaching 25-30 m/s. This overlap of instability and shear favors organized convection, including multicells and supercells. Forecast soundings show veering wind profiles and low LCLs, enhancing the risk of large hail, damaging wind gusts, and an isolated tornado especially in areas where deeper boundary-layer mixing and storm interactions occur.

Austria and Slovakia feature a slightly more marginal but still unstable profile, with CAPE values around 700-900 J/kg and bulk shear in the 15-20 m/s range. Mid-level lapse rates remain steep, and wind profiles are generally more straight-lined, pointing toward organized multicells or short-lived transient supercells. Primary risks include hail and strong outflow winds, but with lower tornado potential than farther northwest.

In Switzerland, the sounding indicates limited instability (CAPE ~400-600 J/kg) and modest shear, with a drier mid-level layer and some capping evident. These factors likely suppress deeper convective development.
While isolated thunderstorms remain possible in terrain-favored zones, the severe weather potential is low.
