## Overview of the Situation

A volatile thunderstorm setup is in forecast the Alps-to-Pannonian corridor. The most intense environment is tentatively flagged as a Moderate Risk stretching from Slovenia into adjoining portions of Austria and far-western Hungary, though this zone will almost certainly be refined once higher-resolution guidance arrives. Surrounding it lies an Enhanced Risk that arcs north-westward across central Austria and into southern Germany, while a broader Slight Risk extends across the northern Alps, southern/central Germany and parts of Switzerland. Farther east a Marginal Risk covers Slovakia and eastern Hungary, where models hint at sporadic convection but also a strong chance that activity devolves into stratiform rain. Key ingredients across the region include a moist, strongly unstable warm sector pooling against the Alps, 30-40 kt of effective bulk-shear, and a sharpening lee-side surface trough that should focus initiation within or just north of the Julian Alps before storms sweep east-north-east through the afternoon and evening.

## Synopsis

Moderate-Risk core (Slovenia -> Austria -> W Hungary). Soundings in Slovenia sample 2000+ J/kg of deep, uncapped CAPE beneath lapse rates near 8 K km-1 and 0-6 km shear around 25 m s-1. Veering low-level flow yields modest curvature, favouring discrete supercells with very large hail and damaging downbursts. The Austrian MDT profile shows an equally buoyant but more weakly capped column; once storms breach the cap they should explode, then track into western Hungary where the local sounding remains very moist but a little less sheared-suggesting upscale growth into a forward-propagating MCS with a primary wind and hail threat.

Enhanced-Risk belt (central Austria & S Germany). Here CAPE tails to 1500-2000 J/kg yet shear stays in the 15-25 m s-1 range. Austrian and Bavarian soundings share steep mid-level lapse rates and gently veering hodographs, favouring organised multicells and a few transient supercells. Large hail and scattered severe gusts are the main hazards, with an outside chance of a brief tornado on any cell that can tap locally backed surface winds.

Slight-Risk fringe (Switzerland & central/n-Germany). Profiles still contain 800-1400 J/kg CAPE but capping and mid-level drying are more pronounced, particularly in Switzerland where alpine subsidence is evident. Guidance hints many storms here may remain elevated or morph quickly into stratiform rain, keeping severe reports sparse and isolated to marginal hail or gusty outflows.

Marginal-Risk zone (Slovakia & E Hungary). Both soundings display modest elevated instability atop a stout low-level inversion with only 10-15 m s-1 of shear. Morning or midday convection is possible in warm-advection/isentropic-lift regimes, but storms should be short-lived and largely non-severe, producing brief downpours or small hail at best.

In summary, the greatest concern is for supercells initiating over Slovenia and adjoining Alpine slopes, then racing east-north-east into Austria and Hungary where they may consolidate into a severe wind-producing complex. Surrounding regions will still see storms, but with progressively lower organisation and severity the farther one moves away from the Alpine/Pannonian corridor.
