## Overview of the Situation

A broad convective setup is unfolding over Central Europe as a warm and moist boundary layer is in place across Germany, Czechia, and Austria, while Poland shows more stable conditions. A slowly progressing mid-level trough and modest upper-level support help maintain an environment supportive of scattered thunderstorms, particularly during the afternoon and evening hours.

## Synopsis

The atmospheric environment over Germany, Czechia, and Austria shows many similarities, with moderate instability, favorable low-level moisture, and deep-layer shear in the 15-25 m/s range, which collectively support scattered thunderstorms. In contrast, Poland stands out with a much more stable profile, significantly limiting convective potential.

In Germany, the soundings reveal a well-mixed boundary layer and steep mid-level lapse rates, favoring surface-based convection during the day. Although the wind profile supports only modestly organized storms, multicell clusters are likely, with the potential for marginally severe hail and gusty winds, especially in areas where localized convergence or lift is present due to a high amount of DCAPE.

Czechia displays a similar thermodynamic setup, with moderate surface-based CAPE and low LCLs (~800-1000 m), which favor storm initiation during peak heating. Wind shear is comparable to Germany's, supporting multicells and short-lived line segments, with heavy rain and strong wind gusts as primary hazards. Some low-level backing of winds hints at brief, weak mesocyclone potential, especially if storms deviate from the mean flow.

Austria shares much of Czechia's instability and moisture but benefits from slightly stronger shear (up to 25 m/s) and a more veered wind profile aloft. This makes more organized convection possible, especially over mountainous or orographically influenced regions, where locally stronger storms with large hail, stronger gusts, and isolated supercell characteristics may emerge.

In contrast, Poland shows a markedly stable sounding, with weak lapse rates, low CAPE, and very limited low-level moisture. This results in a strong cap, preventing convective initiation despite regional dynamics. Shear is also relatively weak, and the overall setup does not support thunderstorms development, yet if storms break the cap, they can reach severe criteria.
