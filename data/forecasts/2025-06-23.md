## Overview of the Situation

A dynamic severe weather setup is evolving across parts of Central Europe, centered on an Enhanced Risk (ENH) area that stretches from eastern Germany through western Poland into northern Czechia, surrounded by a broader Slight Risk (SLGT) extending into southern Germany, Austria, parts of Poland, and Switzerland. The primary threats include severe hail, damaging winds, and potentially a few tornadoes, especially in the ENH zone, where the environment supports organized supercellular development. In the SLGT zone, thermodynamics and shear are less robust but still supportive of isolated to scattered severe storms.

## Synopsis

Soundings across the ENH zone show a remarkably consistent severe profile, with CAPE values ranging from 1500 to 2300 J/kg, suggesting rich thermodynamic energy. Deep-layer shear is strong (20-25 m/s), more than sufficient to support supercells, with elongated hodographs and moderate low-level curvature in several profiles. Lapse rates in the mid-levels are steep (near 7.5-8.0 K/km), especially over Germany and Poland, and moist low-levels with LCLs between 800-1200 m support surface-based storms.

In Germany, the profile indicates a particularly explosive setup, with very strong instability and excellent wind profiles. Storms here could easily rotate and organize into long-track supercells, with the potential for very large hail and damaging winds, and a tornado cannot be ruled out. The Czech sounding is very similar, with slightly less pronounced low-level shear, but still within the range for severe multicells and supercells, especially given the instability and steep lapse rates. Poland shows a nearly mirrored setup, with ample CAPE, solid shear, and a moist column. A slightly more elevated structure may limit the tornado potential there, but hail and wind remain prominent threats. Overall, the ENH region is strongly primed for discrete to semi-discrete convection, initially in the form of supercells, which may later evolve into larger convective clusters or even MCSs, especially during the evening transition.

In the surrounding SLGT zone, conditions are still favorable for thunderstorms, but with a few notable downgrades compared to the ENH region. CAPE values range from 600 to 1300 J/kg, especially in southern Germany and Austria, with lower moisture content in the mid-levels reducing instability compared to farther north. Wind shear remains moderate (10-20 m/s), which is supportive of organized multicells and isolated supercells, especially in the German SLGT areas adjacent to the ENH core.

The Austrian sounding suggests a somewhat capped environment, but with sufficient surface heating, initiation could occur, bringing isolated large hail or gusty winds. Poland's SLGT profile, farther east, also supports some instability but shows more elevated characteristics, likely producing elevated storms with hail as the main concern. Switzerland, which is entirely within the SLGT risk, exhibits the least volatile profile overall. CAPE is marginal, shear is modest, and some capping is evident. Thunderstorms are still possible here, especially with terrain assistance, but the severe potential appears low and mostly conditional.
