## Overview of the Situation

On May 21, 2025, atmospheric soundings across Central Europe-including Czechia, Poland, Germany, Switzerland, and Hungary-indicate a moderately unstable environment conducive to convective development. Surface-based CAPE values range from approximately 800 to 1200 J/kg, and lifted indices are around -2 to -3, suggesting sufficient buoyancy for thunderstorm formation. Wind shear is moderate, with 0-6 km shear values between 20 and 30 m/s, which could support organized convection if storms initiate.

## Synopsis

In Czechia, Poland, Germany and Hungary the atmospheric profile reveals a moist boundary layer with dew points near 12C, contributing to the available instability. Mid-level lapse rates are steep, enhancing the potential for strong updrafts. The hodograph indicates modest directional shear, with some curvature in the lower levels, which may support rotating updrafts in any developing storms. Precipitable water values are elevated, suggesting that any convection could produce locally heavy rainfall. While the environment is conducive to thunderstorm development, the presence of convective inhibition (CIN) near -50 J/kg implies that initiation will likely depend on mesoscale features such as surface convergence zones or orographic lifting, which will be present as a cold front moving trough.

In Switzerland, the sounding indicates a slightly more unstable atmosphere, with higher CAPE values and steeper lapse rates. Wind shear remains moderate, and the moisture profile supports the potential for heavy rainfall. The combination of these factors suggests a higher likelihood of convective development.

Overall, the synoptic environment across Central Europe on May 21, 2025, is moderately conducive to convective development. While instability and moisture are sufficient for thunderstorm formation, the presence of convective inhibition suggests that storm initiation will be contingent upon localized lifting mechanisms such as surface convergence zones, orographic lifting, or mesoscale boundaries. Should storms develop, the moderate wind shear present across the region could support organized convection capable of producing strong wind gusts, hail, and locally heavy rainfall.
