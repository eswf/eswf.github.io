## Overview of the Situation

A widespread severe weather outbreak is developing across Central Europe, with the most volatile conditions centered over Austria, where I placed two separate Moderate Risks due to extremely favorable thermodynamics and kinematics. Surrounding areas across Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, and southern Germany are within an Enhanced Risk, supported by strong instability and shear conducive to supercells, large to very large hail, damaging winds, and possibly tornadoes. The broader environment extends outward into a Slight Risk zone, where conditions remain supportive of scattered strong to severe storms, albeit with more marginal ingredients.

## Synopsis

The highest threat is concentrated in Austria, where both MDT risks soundings present classic high-end severe profiles. SBCAPE exceeds 3000 J/kg, mid-level lapse rates reach around 8 K/km, and effective shear is in the 25-30 m/s range - an environment primed for long-lived supercells. One profile shows a strong cap, indicating possible delayed initiation, while the other is more uncapped with stronger low-level veering, enhancing tornado potential. These soundings strongly support the development of very large hail, damaging wind gusts (DCAPE up to 1000 J/kg), and isolated tornadoes.

Surrounding this MDT area, the Enhanced Risk zone across Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, and southern Germany also supports significant severe weather. CAPE values in these regions range from 1800 to 2600 J/kg, with 15-25 m/s of shear, allowing for organized multicells and supercells. Austria's outer zones still exhibit high instability but slightly less dynamic shear compared to the MDT core. Czechia's profile shows moist, buoyant low levels and strong mid-level lapse rates, supporting large hail and supercell development. Slovakia shows similar thermodynamics, with a slightly lower shear environment but still strong enough for organized storms and possible training convection. Germany's Enhanced Risk area has modest veering and good instability, but slightly drier profiles, favoring hail and wind over tornadoes.

The Slight Risk areas extend into eastern Czechia, northern Germany, Poland, and Switzerland. Here, CAPE drops to around 800-1500 J/kg, and effective shear is lower, around 10-15 m/s. These areas are more capped, particularly in Switzerland and northern Germany, and may see more elevated or pulse-type storms. Poland's profile is a bit more unstable but lacks deep shear support, limiting organization. In general, the Slight Risk regions support isolated storms with some marginal hail and gusty winds, though the environment is not as favorable for sustained severe convection.

Discrete supercells are favored early in the MDT and ENH zones, with very large hail and potential tornadoes. As the event progresses, upscale growth into MCS or bowing segments is possible, especially moving toward evening. The surrounding SLGT zones are less favorable but could still yield marginal severe reports.
