## Elevated risk: Austria, Slovakia

On Thursday, a weak pressure field will remain over Central Europe and the weather in Austria, partly of Slovakia and the outer Czech Republic will be affected by a shallow low pressure area over Hungary. So far, the model suggests that the largest focus of the storms will be from the Alps to the NE in the afternoon. There is a risk of mainly torrential rainfall, stronger wind gusts and locally hail, wind shear values will increase as the evening progresses to values of up to 25m/s. An MCS system in the evening cannot be ruled out, which will move quickly to the NE, with a risk of strong wind gusts at the front or directly in its cores. As the night progresses, the risk of hail will decrease and the overall storm activity should weaken in the first half of the night over southern Poland.

## Elevated risk: Italy

Moist air with abundant CAPE will flow from the Adriatic Sea to NE Italy, the shear at 0-6km will be very high - up to 30m/s and there is a risk of very rapid development of strong supercells that will move rapidly to the E/NE and seem to survive all the way to western Slovenia. There is a risk of medium to large hail, gusts of wind and there is a small chance of a tornado. The helicity parameter shows model values of up to 200 SHR, in combination with this setup there is a risk of dangerous supercells with possibility of tornado.
