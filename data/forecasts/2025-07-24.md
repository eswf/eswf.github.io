## Overview of the Situation

A Moderate Risk (MDT) is in effect for parts of Switzerland, where model soundings indicate a concerning environment for organized severe thunderstorms. Key parameters include high CAPE, strong low- and deep-layer shear, and enhanced mid-level lapse rates, all of which support the development of supercells and organized multicell clusters. Main hazards include damaging wind gusts, large hail, and potentially isolated tornadoes.

Surrounding the MDT risk is a broader Enhanced Risk (ENH) that includes Switzerland and parts of Germany. Within this zone, soundings show sufficient CAPE (800–1500 J/kg), well-developed shear profiles (20–30 kt in 0–6 km layers), and moist low-levels, which suggest scattered severe thunderstorms are likely, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. The ENH risk over Czechia and Austria also shows some elevated instability and potential for heavy rainfall, while Slovenia presents a warm and moist boundary layer, favoring convective development.

A large Slight Risk (SLGT) wraps around both ENH areas and extends well into Germany, Austria, Czechia, and Slovenia, where pulse-type thunderstorms may become strong to locally severe, especially under peak heating. In northern Germany (close to the Danish border), a separate SLGT risk is also issued for localized stronger cells.

The Marginal Risk (MRGL) zones encompass the outer edges of the SLGT areas, where conditions are not as favorable but isolated storms could either develop or propagate into these areas. A separate MRGL zone in Poland is designated where weak instability and some moisture may support a few scattered showers, but overall severe potential is low.

## Synopsis

The MDT risk sounding over Switzerland reveals MLCAPE values exceeding 2000 J/kg, a well-mixed boundary layer, and a curved hodograph with 30–40 kt of effective shear. This setup supports rotating storms with significant updrafts, promoting large hail and severe wind gusts, particularly in the mid- to late-afternoon period.

The ENH risk soundings (e.g., southern Germany and Switzerland) show moderate to strong instability (1000–1500 J/kg), effective bulk shear around 25–30 kt, and steep mid-level lapse rates near 7°C/km. Such profiles support multicells, organized clusters, and possibly some transient supercells. Further east in Czechia, Austria, and Slovenia, soundings suggest moist profiles, moderate CAPE, and weaker low-level shear, favoring more heavy rain-producing convection with embedded stronger cores.

Within the SLGT risk, particularly over central Germany and parts of Austria, soundings indicate moderate CAPE (~800–1000 J/kg) and weak to moderate shear, which points toward diurnally driven pulse storms, some of which may briefly become severe. In Czechia, while instability is more limited, storms approaching from the south and west could bring heavy stratiform or convective rain.

In northern Germany, the SLGT2 area shows modest instability and slightly enhanced low-level shear, suggesting the chance for isolated strong storms, though storm coverage will likely be low. The MRGL zones are characterized by weak CAPE and limited shear, where non-severe showers or isolated lightning-producing cells may form.

In Poland, the sounding shows low instability, but some weak lift and residual moisture could support scattered showers or low-topped thunderstorms, though any severe risk is minimal.
