## Overview of the Situation

On May 28, 2025, Central Europe is under the influence of a dynamic synoptic pattern characterized by positive geopotential height anomalies over Southwestern Europe and negative anomalies over Scandinavia and Southeastern Europe. This configuration supports an intense mid to upper-level jet over Northwestern Europe, extending into Central Europe, fostering conditions conducive to convective development. A progressive open wave traversing from the southern German Bay towards the Baltic Sea introduces a tropical airmass into its warm sector, enhancing moisture availability up to the 500-300 hPa layer. This setup, combined with a slowly advancing cold front, sets the stage for convective activity across the region.

## Synopsis

The atmospheric sounding for Czechia on May 28, 2025, indicates a moderately unstable environment. The presence of a moist boundary layer, with dew points around 12C, and surface temperatures near 20C, contributes to CAPE value sufficient for convective initiation. Wind profiles exhibit modest shear, with 0-3 km shear around 10-15 m/s, supporting the development of organized multicell clusters and transient supercells. The low-level jet and associated helicity values suggest a potential for isolated tornadoes, particularly in areas where cells can ingest streamwise vorticity. Given these conditions, thunderstorms capable of producing strong to severe gusts, hail, and heavy rainfall are anticipated, especially in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country.

The sounding data for central Germany reveals a more pronounced instability compared to neighboring regions. Surface temperatures approaching 22C, coupled with dew points around 14C, result in higher CAPE values, enhancing the potential for vigorous updrafts. Wind shear profiles are notable, with 0-6 km shear exceeding 20 m/s and elongated hodographs, indicative of a favorable environment for supercell development. The presence of a well-defined cold front, intersecting during peak diurnal heating, further augments the risk. Consequently, central and southeastern Germany are poised for severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail, damaging winds, and isolated tornadoes, particularly in areas where mesoscale boundaries enhance low-level shear.

In Switzerland, the sounding data reflects a moderately unstable atmosphere, with surface temperatures around 19C and dew points near 11C. The vertical wind profile shows modest shear, with 0-3 km shear values around 10 m/s, sufficient for the organization of multicell clusters. However, the complex topography of the region may locally enhance shear and vorticity, especially in valley regions. While the overall severe weather threat is lower compared to Germany and Czechia, isolated thunderstorms capable of producing strong gusts and small hail cannot be ruled out, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country.

The atmospheric profile for northeastern Austria indicates conditions marginally supportive of severe convection. Surface temperatures near 21C and dew points around 13C contribute to moderate CAPE values. Wind shear is modest, with 0-3 km shear approximately 10 m/s, suggesting a potential for organized multicell storms. Given the proximity to the advancing cold front and the influence of the upper-level jet, there is a risk for thunderstorms producing strong winds and hail. The potential for isolated tornadoes exists, particularly in areas where local topography or mesoscale features enhance low-level shear.

The synoptic setup on May 28, 2025, fosters an environment conducive to convective development across Central Europe. Germany and Czechia face the highest risk for severe thunderstorms, including the potential for supercells, large hail, damaging winds, and isolated tornadoes. Switzerland and Austria, while experiencing a comparatively lower threat, should remain vigilant for isolated strong storms, especially in regions where local factors may enhance convective potential.
