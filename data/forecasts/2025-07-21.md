## Overview of the Situation

A Moderate Risk (MDT) has been issued for parts of Czechia, Poland, and Austria in association with a strong cold front forecast to sweep across Central Europe. This front is expected to trigger widespread and well-organized thunderstorms, some of which may become severe to locally intense, especially in the MDT zone. Hazards include damaging wind gusts, hail, and possibly isolated tornadoes.

Surrounding the MDT risk, a broad Enhanced Risk (ENH) extends across additional parts of the same countries, where storm coverage and intensity will remain elevated. These regions may experience clusters of strong storms with locally severe wind and hail.

Further outward, Slight Risk (SLGT) and Marginal Risk (MRGL) zones extend into Germany and Switzerland, with SLGT mainly in areas with moderate instability and MRGL covering peripheral zones where thunderstorms are more isolated and severe weather less likely.

## Synopsis

Soundings from the MDT risk zone in Czechia, Poland, and Austria reveal strong mid- to upper-level flow, sufficient deep-layer shear, and ample instability, particularly ahead of the advancing cold front. This setup is highly supportive of organized convection, including line segments and supercells, capable of producing damaging winds, large hail, and brief tornadoes, especially where low-level shear is enhanced.

Within the ENH risk, thermodynamic parameters remain strong, though slightly less impressive than in the core MDT area. Forecast soundings in Austria, Czechia, and Poland within this zone suggest the potential for scattered severe storms, with hail and gusty winds being the main concerns.

The SLGT risk, extending into Germany and Switzerland, shows moderate CAPE and weaker shear, supporting isolated to scattered thunderstorms. Severe weather will be more localized but not out of the question. Soundings here support multicell convection with occasional hail and gusty winds.

The MRGL risk surrounds all higher-tier zones and includes areas where scattered showers and a few thunderstorms are possible. However, due to limited instability or shear, these storms are likely to remain weak and short-lived.
